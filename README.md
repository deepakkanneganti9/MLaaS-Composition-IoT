We propose a novel framework for the composition of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) to address the
evolving demands of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The framework uses composition
to combine diverse machine learning techniques, enabling seamless integration of MLaaS services. The framework introduces
a new composability model designed to evaluate and ensure compatibility between MLaaS services, tackling key challenges
such as model architecture, training data heterogeneity, and the stochastic nature of model performance post-integration.
The framework employs a k-dominant skyline-based filtering method to identify candidate services efficiently. A multi-armed
bandit (MAB) based algorithm is proposed to find the desired MLaaS composition plan. Experimental evaluations using a 
realworld dataset demonstrate the framework’s efficacy in achieving scalable, accurate, and efficient service compositions
